    <p>Business growth means being customer-centric. We must understand who our current and potential customers are, and then deliver to their wants and needs. We must improve retention and loyalty while attracting new customers. And because of changing market conditions, threats to the gas industry, and regulatory challenges, we need to change the way we service our customers by shifting from delivering gas, to delivering energy solutions</p>

    <p>One of the ways we’re approaching these issues is by launching new products and services. Offering products helps us to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Begin positioning the business as an energy services company</li>
      <li>Start working with regulatory bodies to transform our business</li>
      <li>Educate customers on the role of natural gas for sustainable energy and decarbonization.</li>

    <p>Our strategies come with deliverables, action plans, and timelines. There are always lots of moving parts and collaborative efforts required between departments. That’s included.</p>

    <p>Once a new product or service is launched, the goal is to sustain the customer interest and momentum achieved in the initial launch. Here, we track, measure and assess KPIs. If adjustments need to be made, we remain flexible and nimble to get it done.</p>

    <p>All in all, the processes are extremely thorough with the goal of over-delivering on customer demands and company growth.</p>

  2024.1</li>

  <div class="pattern content">
    <p>With a Q2 target launch date, Market Strategy is initiating a pilot program with AGL to offer Generac backup generators to residential customers. The program creates new avenues for meeting customer demand, increasing customer engagement opportunities, and positioning us as a go-to resource for energy solutions. Plus, the program creates a new revenue stream that will be given back to customers by putting downward pressure on rate increases.</p>
